<p>Bike Sharing is our favourites, but we also like boat sharing and car sharing. </p>

<p>Beside sharing bikes, we love to share software. There are so many sharing platforms developing their own websites and App's. We raised the question: How would the world be if we share this knowledge and software? How would it be if we work together to enable bike sharing everywhere on this planet.
Feel free to contact us. We love to hear from you.</p>
